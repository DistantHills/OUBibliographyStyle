# OUBibliographyStyle
File to do OU-Harvard-style referencing in Word.  Not perfect but better than the built-in ones
Original version by Estella Warwick/Chesneau June 2021.  I'll continue to work on it if I do another OU course.

Notes for using it:
- store in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Bibliography\Style
- restart Word to pick up
- change the Biblio style in Word

Notes for editing:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/word/concepts/working-with-word/working-with-bibliographies has info on how the files work.  This one is based on one of the existing ones (can't remember which), and is pretty complex compared with the example on that web page
